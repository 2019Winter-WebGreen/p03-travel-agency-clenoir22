        <h1> Why <b>YOU</b> Should Travel To <u>New Zealand</u></h1>
        <hr/>
     <!-- this is a paragraph on why you should go to new zealand-->
        <p> New Zealand is a beautiful and tropical island off. New Zealand is located 1,200 miles east of Australia across the Tasman Sea in the Pacific Ocean. There are so many sights to see there. The country geographically comprises two main landmasses—the North Island, the South Island, and around 600 smaller islands. The two main islands are separated by the Cook Strait. <p/> <!-- these are reviews that people wrote on new zealand-->Matthew and his family said~ <blockquote>"We cannot express enough how pleased we are with how our trip turned out. The island is beautifl and the cities and twons are so pretty. Our favorite activity we did was whale watching! We saw 3 whales. Ziplining was a close second also."</blockquote>Jared went with his wife and they said~<blockquote> "We are so pleased with how our first trip turned out! When we have kids we will 100% be going back to New Zealand. Every single activity we did was phenomenal and ran very smoothly. Our favorite was our 30 minuet helecopter ride over the island, it was beautiful." </blockquote>  Sarah and Grace loved their tour guides!! They said~  <blockquote>“Although we were the youngest by at least 25 years, we had an amazing two weeks getting acquainted with our travel partners and exploring the South Island. Our guides, MJ and James were simply amazing; each had their own sense of humor and different areas of expertise. I love the variety of places we stayed at, the amount of activities available, and the flexibility of our schedule.</blockquote>
